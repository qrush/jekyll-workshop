Got this far? Awesome. Bonus round! See how many of these you can get done and shipped!

### Change your site's name

This is an easy one: Crack open `_config.yml` and edit it. You might need to restart Jekyll.

### Create a new post with [Prose.io](http://prose.io/)

Prose is a great little web editor for Jekyll sites. Write a new post with it!

### [When was your site generated?](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/#site_variables)

Jekyll includes several variables you can inject onto your page. Drop in the one that shows when your site was generated, and [format it!](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#filters).

### [Add an include](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#includes)

Includes are a low-fi way to share content across pages that wouldn't make sense to put in a layout

### [Make a new index of posts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#displaying_an_index_of_posts)

Listing posts is something you'll need to do eventually with your Jekyll site. You got that for free with `jekyll new`, but learn how to do it yourself!
